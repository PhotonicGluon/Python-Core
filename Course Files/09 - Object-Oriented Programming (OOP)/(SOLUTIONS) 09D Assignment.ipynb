    "In this assignment you will implement a 2D vector class, named `Vector`, and a direction vector class, named `DirectionVector`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A vector has a **source** and a **destination** point. The following point has a source point of $(1, 2)$ and a destination point of $(3, 4)$.\n",

    "\n",
    "A vector's *direction vector* is a vector telling us how much the $x$ and $y$ coordinates changed. For example, a vector starting at point $(1, 2)$ and ending at point $(3, 4)$ has direction vector $(3 - 1, 4 - 2) = (2, 2)$. Here are some more examples of vectors and their associated direction vectors.\n",

    "Adding vectors is easy. For example, consider the following vectors:\n",
    "- A *red* vector starting at $(1,2)$ and ending at $(3,4)$.\n",
    "- A *blue* vector starting at $(1, 2)$ and ending at $(4, 3)$.\n",

    "    <img src=\"images/red-and-blue-vectors.png\" width=200 alt=\"Red and Blue Vectors\">\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of adding two vectors is the same as adding the second vector's *direction vector* to the first vector. **Order does not matter**, as seen in the following example. Summing the red vector before the blue vector or summing the blue vector before the red vector both yield the same resultant vector, starting at $(1,2)$ and ending at $(6,5)$.\n",

    "    <img src=\"images/vector-addition.png\" width=500, alt=\"Vector Addition\">\n",

    "However, it should be noted that vector addition is only valid **if the two vectors originate at the same point**. An exception to this rule are *direction vectors*: they can be added to any vector."
